# Data-Mart-Analysis-Project
The Data Mart Analysis Project utilized SQL to effectively process, clean, and analyze sales data, transforming raw information into actionable insights. This project began with the establishment of a database and table designed to store weekly sales data, encompassing attributes such as region, platform, customer type, and sales figures. The initial phase focused on data setup and cleansing, where SQL transformations were applied to enhance data quality. This included replacing null segments with "Unknown," categorizing customers into age bands (e.g., "Young Adults," "Retirees"), defining demographics as "Couples" or "Families," and calculating the average transaction value for each record.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Following the data cleansing, the project progressed to exploratory data analysis (EDA), where SQL queries were employed to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. Key insights included identifying missing week numbers by comparing available weeks against a pre-generated sequence. The analysis also calculated total transactions per year, providing a comprehensive overview of sales activity over time. Regional sales trends were examined by analyzing monthly sales across different regions, highlighting performance variations by location. Additionally, platform performance was assessed by determining the total transactions by platform, which helped gauge the popularity of each sales channel.

Advanced Insights:
The project further delved into advanced insights by comparing sales percentages between Retail and Shopify platforms on a monthly basis, revealing which platform was dominant during specific periods. An analysis of demographic contributions provided a deeper understanding of how different customer segments impacted yearly sales. Furthermore, the project identified which age bands and demographics contributed most significantly to Retail sales, offering valuable information for refining marketing strategies.
